=Particl Improvement Proposals (PIP)=

==Description==
A Particl Improvement Proposal (PIP) is a design document providing information to the Particl community, or describing a new feature for Particl or its processes or environment. The PIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend PIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Particl. The PIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
